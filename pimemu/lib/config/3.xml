<!-- Example PIM Emulation setup file -->
<!-- The devices described in this XML file are the devices that software sees when using the PIM API
     but they need not exist on the real hardware.
     A resourceful program will use pim_get_device_info() to get these values and learn more about the hardware it's running on.
     This file describes a system with the same EHP as 1.xml, but with three PIMs.
     Unlike 1.xml, the first PIM contains 2 CPU cores. The second PIM looks the same as the one in 1.xml. The third PIM has no GPU. -->
