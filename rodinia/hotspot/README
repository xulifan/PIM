Domain decomposition for OpenCL:

	size_t global_work_size[2];
	global_work_size[0] = BLOCK_SIZE * blockCols;
	global_work_size[1] = BLOCK_SIZE * blockRows;
	size_t local_work_size[2];
	local_work_size[0] = BLOCK_SIZE;
	local_work_size[1] = BLOCK_SIZE;

Domain decomposition for multiple PIMs:
    each PIM get some number of columns
    each PIM simulates all Rows of its own columns
